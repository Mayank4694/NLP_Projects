# Spam_Email_Classification_using_NLP

### About Dataset
#### Overview:
This dataset contains a collection of emails, categorized into two classes: "Spam" and "Non-Spam" (often referred to as "Ham"). These emails have been carefully curated and labeled to aid in the development of spam email detection models. 


#### Context:
Spam emails continue to be a significant issue, with malicious actors attempting to deceive users with unsolicited, fraudulent, or harmful messages. This dataset is designed to facilitate research, development, and testing of algorithms and models aimed at accurately identifying and filtering spam emails, helping protect users from various threats.

#### Content:
The dataset includes the following features:
- Message: The content of the email, including the subject line and message body.
- Category: Categorizes each email as either "Spam" or "Ham" (Non-Spam).

#### Potential Use Cases:

1. Email Filtering: Develop and evaluate email filtering systems that automatically classify incoming emails as spam or non-spam.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use the email text for text classification, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.
3. Machine Learning: Create machine learning models for spam detection, potentially employing various algorithms and techniques.
4. Feature Engineering: Explore email content features that contribute to spam classification accuracy.
5. Data Analysis: Investigate patterns and trends in spam email content and characteristics.

#### Data Preprocessing
Emails must be preprocessed to convert raw text into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.

- Tokenization: Splitting the text into words or tokens.
- Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- Removing Punctuation and Stop Words: Cleaning the text by removing unnecessary punctuation and stop words (common words that don't add much meaning).
- Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.

#### Feature Extraction
Convert the processed text into numerical features that can be fed into a machine learning model.

- Bag of Words (BoW): Represents text as a collection of word frequencies.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weighs the importance of words in a document relative to the entire corpus.
- Word Embeddings: Using pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe to capture the semantic meaning of words.
